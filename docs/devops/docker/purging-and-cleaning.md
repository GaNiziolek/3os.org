# Purge Unused or Dangling Images

Purging All Unused or Dangling Images, Containers, Volumes, and Networks
Docker provides a single command that will clean up any resources — images, containers, volumes, and networks — that are dangling (not associated with a container):

```bash
docker system prune
```

To additionally remove any stopped containers and all unused images (not just dangling images), add the -a flag to the command:

```bash
docker system prune -a
```
