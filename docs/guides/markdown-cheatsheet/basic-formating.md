# Basic Formating

## Heading

Headings from `h1` through `h6` are constructed with a `#` for each level:

### Regular Headings

```markdown
### The 3rd level

#### The 4th level

##### The 5th level

###### The 6th level
```

**Result:**

### The 3rd level

#### The 4th level

##### The 5th level

###### The 6th level

### Headings <small>with secondary text</small>

```markdown
### The 3rd level <small>with secondary text</small>

#### The 4th level <small>with secondary text</small>

##### The 5th level <small>with secondary text</small>

###### The 6th level <small>with secondary text</small>
```

**Result:**

### The 3rd level <small>with secondary text</small>

#### The 4th level <small>with secondary text</small>

##### The 5th level <small>with secondary text</small>

###### The 6th level <small>with secondary text</small>
