description: Brewup script is a Bash script that uses [Homebrew - The Missing Package Manager for macOS](https://brew.sh/) as it's base.Brewup uses GitHub as a "backup" of a config file which contains all installed Taps, Formulas, Casks and App Store Apps at your macOS. It also allows the use of __Github__ main function of retaining changes so you can always look up for the package that were installed sometime ago and you just forgot what is was exactly.
