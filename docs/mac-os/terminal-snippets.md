# Terminal Snippets

Terminal usage snippets for macOS. This is a collection of snippets that I use without specific category.

## Install macOS Updates via CLI

```shell
softwareupdate -i -a
```

## Install Command Line Tools

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

## Shell Safe rm

Source [shell-safe-rm github](https://github.com/kaelzhang/shell-safe-rm/blob/master/README.md)

A much safer replacement of shell `rm` with _ALMOST FULL_ features of the origin `rm` command.

Initially developed on Mac OS X, then tested on Linux.

Using `safe-rm`, the files or directories you choose to remove will move to `$HOME/.Trash` instead of simply deleting them. You could put them back whenever you want manually.

If a file or directory with the same name already exists in the Trash, the name of newly-deleted items will be ended with the current date and time.

Install with npm:

```shell
npm i -g safe-rm
```

Add Alias to your _zshrc_ config

```shell
alias rm='safe-rm'
```

## Disable StrictHostKeyChecking in SSH

To disable strict host checking on OS X for the current user,
create or edit `~/.ssh/ssh_config` and add the following lines:

```shell
StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

## Set macOS Hostname via CLI

```shell
sudo scutil --set HostName <NewHostNameHere>
```

## Syntax Highlighting for Nano

Install Nano from homebrew
Create `~/.nanorc` file with the syntax below

```shell
brew install nano
touch ~/.nanorc
```

Edit `~/.nanorc` file with the syntax below
